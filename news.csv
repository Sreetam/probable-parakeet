Instead she is stuck in the past  A new school year is under way, and already pressures are acute. The  six-month freeze  on energy bills promised by the prime minister offers short-term relief but leaves headteachers to puzzle over what happens next. Schools in England are expected to turn to reserves – if they have them. With a 5% pay rise for teachers also due to come out of existing budgets, finances are precarious.  Teaching assistants’ jobs are at risk, along with  educational trips . Senior Conservative figures are among those  warning  that high inflation and funding shortfalls are placing headteachers in an impossible position. The post-pandemic catchup is far from complete, after the  botched outsourcing  of the main tutoring contract. Added to these problems is a shortage of teachers that ministers have known about for years. A recruitment and retention strategy announced in 2019 has not brought results. Instead, new figures show that the situation is getting worse, with vacancies at their  highest level since 2010 . This year just 25% of the required number of trainee physics teachers have been recruited. Almost half of teachers say they  plan to quit  within five years.

The proposed  privatisation of Channel 4  is one of them: here is the perfect opportunity to quietly drop plans that, even according to the government’s  own consultation paper , hardly anyone wants. Nadine Dorries led the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport   (DCMS) up to the top of the ideological hill, like the grand old Duke of York, without checking that her muskets were primed. So the government’s tactics, such as meddling with the wording of the channel’s annual report to bring it to heel, looked petty and ridiculous because its field commander  appeared not to understand  what exactly it would be privatising.  The set-up of Channel 4 is admittedly complicated. Established by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1982 to produce “innovative, alternative content that challenges the status quo”, it is publicly owned but commercially funded. Unlike the BBC – which is financed through the licence fee – it makes no call on taxpayers, who would therefore have no financial gain from its privatisation. The advertising market on which it relies is tough, but there are better ways to support it than to flog it off, such as taxing online advertising on commercial streaming platforms,  as suggested by  the Media Reform Coalition.

It was first performed in Baden Baden in the summer of 1869, before a hugely successful transfer to Offenbach’s own theatre, the Bouffes-Parisiens, the following winter. The operetta was taken off, however, during the Franco-Prussian war, and never reestablished itself in the repertory when public opinion swung against its German-born composer after the French defeat. Its outings remain infrequent, though  Opera Rara  have now revived it in concert, with Paul Daniel conducting the London Philharmonic and an excellent, largely francophone cast.  While it lacks the sharp satirical focus of Orphée aux Enfers and La Belle Hélène, it’s an engaging, if preposterous comedy about nouveau riche values and social mobility. Prince Raphaël, played by a mezzo in drag, falls in love with what he believes to be a waxwork of the fabled Princess of Trebizond, only to discover that the object of his affections is, in fact, the very real Zanetta, who works in a circus run by her family. Raphaël is soon at loggerheads with his dictatorial father Casimir, but things are thrown into real disarray when Zanetta and her relatives win the lottery and acquire both an unexpected fortune and sudden status. The score is delightful, with some brilliant numbers: Raphaël has a big aria about toothache, at once funny and wince-inducing; Casimir, the tenor lead, throws tantrums in waltz time; and there’s a hilarious plate-spinning quintet for the ennobled circus family, now bored out of their skulls by wealth and hankering after the old days.

People stood through the night, in a miles-long line that ran through central London, to pay their last respects to the Queen, lying in state. The TV coverage was almost soothing in its bland repetition, and its sombre reverence unavoidable.  For those of us of a republican leaning, the whole thing can feel bizarre and alienating, but for many others, the depth of their feeling may have caught them by surprise. “We have a relationship with these public figures,” says  Julia Samuel, a psychotherapist who specialises in bereavement . The Queen, in particular, has “been the backdrop of our lives and this connecting thread. She’s the symbol of the  mother of the nation  and symbol of this idea of predictability, in such a changing, turbulent world.

He sent on the schoolboy Ethan Nwaneri, who had not been born when the Emirates Stadium was completed in 2006: at 15 years and 181 days old, the England under-17 international became Arsenal’s youngest-ever player and the youngest to appear for any team in the Premier League.

Inside the car on the radio, pundits argued about an averted rail strike and documents seized at Mar-a-Lago. Outside, barriers stood to one side from the previous weekend’s ceremony marking the anniversary of the attacks. As Britain closed out its second week of official mourning for the Queen, much of the US had already moved on.  If this disjunct is inevitable, it still gives rise to a strange, split-screen reality for those living in the US with attachments in Britain. Even on the day of the Queen’s death, a note of cautious irony leavened some of the commentary in the US. “Sorry about your Queen,” said friends, parents at the school gate and, for a day or two, every American I encountered who registered my accent.

He wears a black Who concert T-shirt, camouflage-patterned jogging bottoms and a white Mercedes-Benz cap, turned back to front. On one forearm, he has a tattoo of a drawing by his young son, Acey; on the other, the inked paw print of his beloved ex-mutt Georgie.

Yiyun Li was a 33-year-old science graduate of Peking University, a former maths prodigy who had emigrated from China to the US to study immunology and had taken up creative writing in an effort to improve her English. Within two years, she had been listed as one of  Granta’s 21 best young American novelists , without actually having published a novel, and two of the stories from   A Thousand Years of Good Prayers   had been made into films by the Chinese American director Wayne Wang.  In two novels and a second short story collection published over the next decade she continued to focus on Chinese lives, observed through a long-distance telescope, but then suddenly everything changed. She started to write about herself, she embraced the first person for the first time in her fiction, and she began to range beyond China. “At the beginning,” says Li, from her home in Princeton, New Jersey, where she has a day job as a professor of creative writing, “people thought: ‘Here is a very nice Chinese lady who could write in English’ – but I’m not that kind of nice, friendly lady who can also just write a little. Being subversive is important to me.

The media are suddenly  awash  with “we” and “us”. All those flowers, flags and banners embody the same message: that whatever this country’s tensions and resentments, the United Kingdom remains exactly that. But, by a grim accident of timing, when politics resumes this week the biggest story will be about something that suggests the exact opposite: a government so unconcerned by the huge gaps that divide people and places that it is going to widen them even further.  Friday will see the much-trailed “fiscal event” in which the new chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, will outline the  details  of the government’s energy prize freeze and the tax cuts promised by Liz Truss in her campaign for the Tory leadership. The Resolution Foundation  reckons  that, on average, the richest tenth of households will benefit from these measures by about £4,700 a year, while the poorest tenth will receive £2,200. By way of adding insult to injury, towards the end of last week news broke of Kwarteng’s push to  remove  the existing cap on banker’s bonuses, a legacy of our membership of the EU. As with Truss’s  hostility  to an extended windfall tax on the big energy companies, here was more proof of her government’s key intention: to “go for growth” by privileging wealthy and powerful people and interests, in the hope that doing so might boost the UK’s output.

What is behind this bias and how can how it be fixed?  Heart diseases are still chronically misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed in women. With depressing regularity, we see stories of  women failed by the health system  when they come to hospitals with the symptoms of a heart attack. As a professor of cardiac science with 40 years’ experience, for me it has been a frustrating journey to get to the real cause of this problem: a combination of professional, systemic and technical biases. The experiences of individual patients are complex to analyse and interpret, but now we can view these effects on a much bigger scale.  Women are  50% more likely  to receive a wrong initial diagnosis; when they are having a heart attack, such mistakes can be fatal. People who are initially misdiagnosed have a 70% higher risk of dying. The latest studies have similarly shown that women have worse outcomes for heart operations such as valve replacements and peripheral revascularisation. As well as being misdiagnosed, women are less likely to be treated quickly, less likely to get the best surgical treatment and less likely to be discharged with the optimum set of drugs. None of this is excusable, but is it understandable?

The final four riders to take on the technical 34.2km course were practically a roll-call of the best against the clock: the two-time European time-trial champion Stefan Küng; the two-time Tour de France winner Tadej Pogacar; the  Vuelta a España winner , Remco Evenepoel; and the defending world time-trial champion, Filippo Ganna.

Frank Auerbach , once described by the Tate as “one of the greatest painters alive today”, has come up with an answer he didn’t expect to find. At 91, he has painted himself – and it’s all thanks to Covid.  For decades, the painter and draughtsman has had friends and family sit for his portraits every week – until the lockdowns left him without any sitters. Instead, he found inspiration in his own features for a major series of self-portraits. He told the  Observer  that, while he had previously been uninterested in his own face, ageing has made it much more compelling.

But now a dizzyingly ambitious project is harnessing all the power of modern science in an attempt to understand what whales say – and then hold conversations with them  Tom Mustill was kayaking with his friend Charlotte in Monterey Bay, California, when an animal three times the size of the largest Tyrannosaurus Rex hurtled from the water and crashed down on their tiny craft. As the flying humpback whale fell upon them and their kayak was sucked beneath the waves, Mustill assumed he would die. Miraculously he and Charlotte found themselves gasping for breath, clinging to their capsized kayak. How had they survived a smash with a creature three times the weight of a double-decker bus?  What happened next was almost as weird. Mustill and Charlotte went viral. Passing whale-watching tourists had videoed the pair’s near-death encounter and stuck it on  YouTube . Mustill, a wildlife filmmaker, became what he calls “a lightning conductor for whale fanatics”. Interviewed by the global media, he was soon quivering with different and extraordinary stories of whale meetings from around the world: a submariner told him about whales singing to his ship; a book publisher reported being apparently scanned by the sonar-like echolocation of a pregnant female dolphin – a few days later, she discovered that she too was pregnant. “It was really addictive finding out all these other stories,” says Mustill, “because each one was like another lens on the animal and our relationship to them.”   Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/18/talking-to-whales-with-artificial-enterprise-it-may-soon-be-possible","http://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","GB","general","[]","set()"

It’s a national disgrace  Despite wearing a supportive EU blue-and-gold hat to the first post-referendum parliament, the Queen’s genius was that she remained a mystery, a blank canvas the whole nation could project its hopes and dreams on to. Personally, I loved the Queen. She hung on long enough to accept, definitively, the resignation of Boris Johnson, who lied to her about  proroguing parliament  and partied under lockdown even though she grieved alone for her late husband, dutifully following the guidance Johnson’s Brexit government had laid down. She knew she could not rest until he was gone.  I’m joking of course. But questions remain. One of the last people the Queen was photographed with was Liz Truss who, as an  18-year-old student politician declared she wanted to see the monarchy destroyed .

That’s a message that has gone around the world in this solemn week of mourning after the Queen’s death. And it sounds like bad news for liberal aspirations for social change. Yet if modern Britain remains the most tradition-oriented of the major liberal democracies, ours is also among the most socially liberal societies that has ever existed.  Britain is a  society transformed  since 1952. I cannot see these as seven decades of retreat from past glories but, rather, as years in which Britain become a kinder, gentler and freer society. The changes were most profound for gay people who could be open about who they loved and for women who wanted to follow a career even if they got married. Ethnic minorities had almost no presence in British public life across the first half of the Queen’s reign. At times, we forget that the big culture clashes of a previous generation have been settled on broadly liberal foundations. Social inequalities have been more stubborn.

First came cancer, then came Covid. But having survived both, the scruffy-sweet Hollywood legend is back on our screens – and relishing every moment  Jeff Bridges at 72 wakes early and lingers a while in bed. Since a battle with lymphatic cancer that began two years ago (“When they found a 9in by 12in mass in my stomach”) and a bad case of Covid he contracted on his local chemo ward (“It made the cancer look like a piece of cake”), rising in the mornings has been a struggle for the veteran Hollywood actor. “I really have to drag myself out of bed,” he says. When Bridges is finally up and about, he stretches, he does a daily breathing exercise so intense it leaves him trembling, he makes coffee, he reads. By the time he’s down in the garage of his Santa Barbara home, maybe noodling about on a musical instrument, or painting, he’ll be feeling and behaving more like the Jeff Bridges that movie-goers have come to know: that beautifully unpolished, scruffy-sweet, growly-squeaky figure, irresistible in deathless works that include   The Fabulous Baker Boys  ,   The Big Lebowski   and   True Grit  .  “Our garage has been converted into my hang,” Bridges explains, showing off its features to me one day. There are cosy rugs on the floor and paperbacks piled on side tables. Musical equipment takes up a whole corner, opposite another corner dedicated to ceramics. Bridges’s own paintings decorate the walls beside photographs of his family, including his brother  Beau , his wife Sue, their three adult daughters and several grandchildren that include a newborn who arrived this year. While Bridges was in isolation, struck down by that cancer and Covid double, Sue arranged for some further additions to the garage. Portable fencing and screen doors were brought in, transforming the space into an indoor-outdoor recuperation room, complete with its own water fountain. Bridges was carried here straight from hospital, hooked up to oxygen tanks, his wheeled bed eventually swapped out for a leather recliner as his health improved.

To understand why, it is necessary to examine the force beyond its equipment and personnel.  The US assesses military capability through the abbreviation DOTMLPF. That senior US officers regularly try to roll this off the tongue as an acronym may exemplify military absurdity, but the abbreviation is somewhat redeemed by being fairly comprehensive. It stands for: doctrine, organisation, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities. Looking at the Russian military across these categories reveals why it is underperforming its potential and struggling to regenerate.

Instead she is stuck in the past  A new school year is under way, and already pressures are acute. The  six-month freeze  on energy bills promised by the prime minister offers short-term relief but leaves headteachers to puzzle over what happens next. Schools in England are expected to turn to reserves – if they have them. With a 5% pay rise for teachers also due to come out of existing budgets, finances are precarious.  Teaching assistants’ jobs are at risk, along with  educational trips . Senior Conservative figures are among those  warning  that high inflation and funding shortfalls are placing headteachers in an impossible position. The post-pandemic catchup is far from complete, after the  botched outsourcing  of the main tutoring contract. Added to these problems is a shortage of teachers that ministers have known about for years. A recruitment and retention strategy announced in 2019 has not brought results. Instead, new figures show that the situation is getting worse, with vacancies at their  highest level since 2010 . This year just 25% of the required number of trainee physics teachers have been recruited. Almost half of teachers say they  plan to quit  within five years.

The proposed  privatisation of Channel 4  is one of them: here is the perfect opportunity to quietly drop plans that, even according to the government’s  own consultation paper , hardly anyone wants. Nadine Dorries led the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport   (DCMS) up to the top of the ideological hill, like the grand old Duke of York, without checking that her muskets were primed. So the government’s tactics, such as meddling with the wording of the channel’s annual report to bring it to heel, looked petty and ridiculous because its field commander  appeared not to understand  what exactly it would be privatising.  The set-up of Channel 4 is admittedly complicated. Established by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1982 to produce “innovative, alternative content that challenges the status quo”, it is publicly owned but commercially funded. Unlike the BBC – which is financed through the licence fee – it makes no call on taxpayers, who would therefore have no financial gain from its privatisation. The advertising market on which it relies is tough, but there are better ways to support it than to flog it off, such as taxing online advertising on commercial streaming platforms,  as suggested by  the Media Reform Coalition.

For our new PM, the problem’s ideological  As this most strange and surreal of national moments has unfolded, voices of power and influence have constantly talked about national unity and shared feeling. The media are suddenly  awash  with “we” and “us”. All those flowers, flags and banners embody the same message: that whatever this country’s tensions and resentments, the United Kingdom remains exactly that. But, by a grim accident of timing, when politics resumes this week the biggest story will be about something that suggests the exact opposite: a government so unconcerned by the huge gaps that divide people and places that it is going to widen them even further.  Friday will see the much-trailed “fiscal event” in which the new chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, will outline the  details  of the government’s energy prize freeze and the tax cuts promised by Liz Truss in her campaign for the Tory leadership. The Resolution Foundation  reckons  that, on average, the richest tenth of households will benefit from these measures by about £4,700 a year, while the poorest tenth will receive £2,200. By way of adding insult to injury, towards the end of last week news broke of Kwarteng’s push to  remove  the existing cap on banker’s bonuses, a legacy of our membership of the EU. As with Truss’s  hostility  to an extended windfall tax on the big energy companies, here was more proof of her government’s key intention: to “go for growth” by privileging wealthy and powerful people and interests, in the hope that doing so might boost the UK’s output.

Today&rsquo;s Highlight in History: 

On Sept. 18, 2020, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a towering women&rsquo;s rights champion who became the court&rsquo;s second female justice, died at her home in Washington at the age of 87 of complications from pancreatic cancer; her death set off a battle over whether President Donald Trump should nominate a successor, or the seat should remain vacant until the outcome of the election six weeks away. (Trump would nominate Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed by the Republican-led Senate days before the election.)

On this date: 

In A.D. 14, the Roman Senate officially confirmed Tiberius as the second emperor of the Roman Empire, succeeding the late Augustus. 

In 1793, President George Washington laid the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol.

Álvarez, the undisputed world super-middleweight champion, was a comprehensive winner and the only surprise was that, for once, the judges were sympathetic to Golovkin. Two scorecards of 115-113 were strange, with the third official’s verdict of 116-112 in favour of Álvarez a marginally more accurate reflection.  Álvarez was too young, too strong and too driven for Golovkin – a once great world champion who is now a 40‑year‑old man in the unforgiving ring. Beneath the glaring lights and the percussive impact of Álvarez’s power punching, Golovkin cut a subdued figure from the outset of a one-sided contest. He was unable to impose himself and, especially in the first seven rounds, he looked a disconsolate version of the previously formidable middleweight champion who dominated his division for so many years.

"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 10:00:00 GMT","1663495200.0","The Time Is Ripe for Commonwealth Countries to Ditch the British Monarchy","In the wake of Queen Elizabeth II’s passing last week, much has been made of her personal affection for not only the people of Britain but also all her subjects spread among the members of the Commonwealth. Her very first televised Christmas broadcast   in 1957 was set against the transition of the British Empire to the Commonwealth of Nations and  described  how she took “pride in the new Commonwealth we are building.” Following her death, this personal commitment to the Commonwealth has been highlighted as a mark of the generosity of the queen’s spirit: that her investment in these distant remnants of former British rule held the institution together by sheer force of will.  As a result, her successor, King Charles III, will ascend to the throne as the head of state for 14 Commonwealth realms too, stretching from Canada to Australia, Jamaica to Papua New Guinea. But barely days into his reign, murmurs of a mass exodus from the Commonwealth club are already stalking the new king. Professor Philip Murphy, the former director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, has  argued  that several countries in the Commonwealth could make “a rush for the door” over the coming years. Will Charles oversee the final disintegration of this remnant of empire?  To think about the Commonwealth’s place in the modern world, it is important to consider what the institution is. The transition from the British Empire to Commonwealth implied that the hierarchy between Britain and its colonies would dissipate with independence. Now each state would be equal to each, sharing sovereignty, status, and wealth in common. But older divisions of geography, race, and economic power continued to slice through this “family of nations.” Think of the differences in movement and access enjoyed by the different people of the Commonwealth. In 1962, the Commonwealth Immigration Act was passed by the Conservative government, which ended the automatic right of people from the British colonies and Commonwealth to settle in the U.K. Though it made all Commonwealth citizens subject to possible immigration control, the target of this law was not white people coming from New Zealand or Australia. Conservative Home Secretary Rab Butler said that the act’s “great merit” was that it looked like it would apply to all parts of the Commonwealth, when in reality its “restrictive effect is intended to, and would in fact, operate on coloured people almost exclusively.” Commonwealth migration came to mean only people migrating from Africa, South Asia, or the Caribbean, not places like Canada, and was discussed by Conservative politicians as a new specter haunting Britain. Enoch Powell, a prominent Conservative member of Parliament, argued that this migration would give rise to “rivers of blood” flowing across the nation, and in his wake, Margaret Thatcher described her fear that with increasing Commonwealth migration, Britain was being “swamped by people with a different culture.” This was not the rhetoric with which the queen liked to suggest that the people of Nigeria, Sri Lanka, or Trinidad and Tobago were family.  Commonwealth countries also carried an array of different sovereignty positions. Some countries are Crown Dependencies, some are British Overseas Territories, and some are independent nation states. These differing statuses have a significant effect not only on their communality but also their wealth. According to a 2019 index produced by the Tax Justice Network, the world’s three most corrosive corporate tax havens are all British Overseas Territories, with the British Virgin Islands topping the list, closely followed by Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. These tax havens are often presented in the media as strange foreign hideouts for dirty money, but they are all ruled by a British governor who represents the crown, carries the final say on the law and, every year leads the celebration of the queen’s birthday in a manner that resurrects the era of the old British West Indies. This subgroup within the Commonwealth lies at the forefront of  global offshore wealth , home to some of the strongest secrecy and tax exemption laws in the world. The appeal of these jurisdictions to the world’s oligarchs lies in their close connection to Britain, while also remaining one step removed. By remaining under the patronage of British sovereignty, maintaining aspects like Charles as the head of state and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as their highest court, these offshore jurisdictions are able to present themselves as part of the long history of English financial and legal expertise, not simply grubby secret money dens.  Even today, in ostensibly independent countries like Jamaica and the Bahamas, if you have a legal dispute, in theory your final hope of resolving it will be a direct appeal to King Charles III.   This more nefarious side of a number of nations that make up the Commonwealth is ignored in sepia-tinged narratives about an old family of nations. But it points us to a material aspect of Britain’s investment in the remnants of empire. This isn’t just about sporting games and cultural exchanges. As well as inheriting Charles as their head of state, a number of Commonwealth countries also will have his Privy Council as their highest court of appeal. The Privy Council, a rather shadowy institution that is home to the formal advisers to the monarch of the U.K., is one of the last routes through which the power of Britain’s ruling king or queen can still be exercised. One of the Privy Council’s roles is to hear legal cases from an array of overseas territories and Commonwealth countries through the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which was once the final court of appeal of the British Empire. The JCPC was created by an 1833 act of Parliament, and was the place where legal issues that arose in the British colonies came to be resolved. This meant that, in theory, all subjects from every corner of the British Empire had the right to appeal directly to the reigning British monarch. Even today, in ostensibly independent countries like Jamaica and the Bahamas, if you have a legal dispute, in theory your final hope of resolving it will be a direct appeal to King Charles III. This functional, legal element of the legacy of British rule across some territories of the Commonwealth shows that the questions being asked in this debate concern more that the “symbolic” role of the monarchy.       The change in monarch comes at an auspicious time for the Commonwealth, as a number of countries —including Jamaica and Australia—  had already been making moves toward removing the queen as head of state, and these calls are likely only to grow now she is being succeeded by her less popular son. Barbados already transitioned into a parliamentary republic in 2021, lighting the way for other Caribbean countries that want to follow in its wake. As the   protests   that greeted Prince William and his wife, Kate, on their tour of the region showed, republican feelings are very much on the rise in the once trusty British West Indies. Meanwhile, much of the British public has only a vague idea of what the Commonwealth actually is. In the past,   polls   have shown that one in five Brits couldn’t name a single Commonwealth country when asked. Not Jamaica, not India, not even Australia.   For a certain strain of the British population, the loss of the Commonwealth sounds like good news. Politicians like Enoch Powell called for Britain to cut ties with former colonies after independence and not engage with the Commonwealth system that came afterward. To them, the Commonwealth was a sham, a way for colonies to keep riding on the motherland’s coattails without paying the due respect. This attitude, of course, overlooks the vast material benefits that Britain has extracted from them. Back in 2002, Boris Johnson wrote about Africa, arguing that “the problem is not that we were once in charge, but that we are not in charge anymore.” This quote came back to haunt him when he later became prime minister and sought to establish trading relationships with the countries in the region with which Britain had “historical ties.” Johnson expressed a desire to turn the Commonwealth from a “great family of nations into a free trade zone” after Brexit.  Perhaps, like the government officials who nicknamed the plan for Britain’s role in the world after Brexit “ Empire 2.0 ,” Johnson forgot that for many Commonwealth countries, the Commonwealth might not hold the same romantic evocations of the nineteenth century as it did for him. This is a lesson that might be in store for the new king as well, if he expects his tenure over the Commonwealth to be as smooth as that of his predecessors.","https://newrepublic.com/article/167772/time-ripe-commonwealth-countries-ditch-british-monarchy","http://www.newrepublic.com/taxonomy/term/17538/feed","US","politics","[]","set()"
