There is a realistic possibility that the increase in losses was partially a result of the Russian air force accepting greater risk in a move to provide close air support to Russian ground forces under pressure from Ukrainian advances, the defence ministry said in its daily intelligence on Twitter. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin – under a travel ban to the UK due to sanctions – had already said he would not attend. But not inviting any Russian representative to the Queen’s funeral was “particularly blasphemous towards Elizabeth II’s memory” and “deeply immoral”, the foreign ministry spokeswoman in Moscow said on Thursday.

It’s an interesting if flawed movie, and I wasn’t sure some of the line-readings and the big dialogue scenes completely came off; but this is the work of a director with a real sense of landscape and place. The scene is the north of Ireland, where a smooth and self-satisfied young businessman has arrived on a short visit: Hamish, played by Cosmo Jarvis, who is alienated from his father, played by Claes Bang, seen only on Zoom calls. Hamish has been bequeathed a remote cottage by an aunt (that is, his mother’s sister) in her will and now he wants to see it. From the outset, the mood is strange, oppressive: Hamish misinterprets some friendly chat from the receptionist (Pauline Hutton) organising his hire car at the airport as a come-on, and is coldly rude. And there is a catastrophe on the road when another car driven by teenage kids crashes into his. Hamish survives, but one teen in the other car is killed. Continue reading..."

We seem to have had a bumper crop this year, and I can’t resist them with their most loyal companion, star anise, a spice that throws an aromatic shawl over their tart fruit flavour. This combination works as beautifully in savoury sauces and ketchups as it does in sweet jams and ice-creams. In this nutty, brown sugar crumble, I draw on the theme, using the aniseed qualities of tarragon alongside the plums: glowing flavours that thrum together with a light crunch. Continue reading..."

In September 2020, Peloton announced a 172% increase in sales from the year prior and more than 1m new signups for its streaming classes. The company, which sold its first bike on Kickstarter in 2013, became known as one of the small group of “winners” from the pandemic and, along with Netflix and Amazon, its share price rocketed. By the end of 2020 it was valued at $45bn. Continue reading..."
