In the clip, Di Giulio strolls through the historic centre of the Tuscan capital when he comes across a woman who appears to be   of Roma origin. Stopping in his tracks, the candidate leans into the camera and implores his audience to “vote the League to never see her again”, a phrase he repeats three times for rhetorical effect.  Most Italians were appalled, and the video went viral. Which was, of course, Di Giulio’s hope all along. You can see it from the smile on his face. He was surely aware, when he uploaded his clip, that there was no chance of voters in his left-leaning constituency shifting their support. His gesture was purely performative, a tacit reminder to political sympathisers across the nation that if Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy wins this week’s election,  as expected , people like him will soon have an opportunity to shape the policy agenda.

All were filmed on what have become  national trails : the long distance walks that came into being after the second world war in response to fears of developers concreting over every square foot of green and pleasant land.  In the first, from 1956, members of a youth fellowship yomp across the South Downs. The scene is like the start of an Ian McEwan novel: young men in stiff wool suits lark about; girls dressed primly like their mothers smile shyly. All look as if they’re gagging for 1963 and the arrival of the  you-know-what Philip Larkin wrote about .

In his writing, however, he is drawn to artistic failure. His debut novel,  Three   Craws  (2016), followed Johnny, a man returning to Fife after hard times in London force him to acknowledge that he’s never going to make it as an artist. Now comes  The Book of the Gaels , the charismatic tale of a struggling poet named Fraser who is about to learn the hard way that literature isn’t going to feed his two boys.  Opening in hardscrabble west Cork in the mid-1970s, it’s narrated by Fraser’s 10-year-old son, Joseph, who, like his younger brother, Paul, spends a lot of time hungry and cold. Their mother drowned in a nearby lough when they were too young to remember, and grief-addled Fraser has since turned to verse. When a letter from a Dublin publisher arrives, it inspires a picaresque road trip to the city, hitchhiking, sneaking ticketless on to buses and stealing into churches to scoff the communion wafers and bed down.

In London the metal grid is adorned with cast bronze reliefs depicting Benin kings and warriors, which remain in the museum’s possession despite being looted by British soldiers over a century ago. In Berlin, by contrast, the rods support a row of plasma screens, on which German and Nigerian curators, officials and activists explain why the bronzes don’t belong in Europe any more.

Similarly, adding Jack Grealish to a Manchester City squad already supremely stocked with attacking talent seemed unnecessary and, despite a crucial goal at West Ham in last season’s title run-in, the move has yet to properly pay off. Grealish began Saturday’s game at Wolves under pressure … and then scored after 55 seconds. He will know that this is not the end of the conversation, and needs to be the start of something more significant. The portents are good: others have taken a season to adjust to the specific demands placed upon them by Guardiola. With defences preoccupied with the demands of handling Erling Haaland, there should be both scope and space for Grealish to deploy his unique brand of improvisational brilliance.

Now he will be leading his team once again  There’s  an old saying  in NFL circles: “If you have two quarterbacks, you actually have none.” Well, tell that to the San Francisco 49ers, who have learned the value of keeping two qualified starters. While the 49ers were criticized for handing backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo a guaranteed one-year deal in the offseason rather than trading him for whatever they could get, the move may have saved their season after Trey Lance  went down with a broken ankle  on Sunday.  The extent of Lance’s injury was not known when the team put Garoppolo – previously labeled “the world’s most expensive backup”  by some of the snarkier members of the media  – on the field against the Seattle Seahawks in the first quarter. As per usual, it was an efficient but not flashy performance from Garoppolo, who had both a passing and rushing touchdown while throwing for 154 yards without a single pick.

To some, it’s simply a person with power – the more brutish and unrestrained, the better. That has been the philosophyof despots for centuries. But for my grandfather, Nelson Mandela, power was something else. It was found in the willingness to commit your entire being to a set of values; to not only advocate for them but to embody them. Come what may.  In that respect, many leaders don’t have power in the ordinary sense that we associate with the term. For people such as my grandfather, their moral courage and strength is what allowed them to exercise influence. What’s more, people often cannot help but align themselves with the values and virtues of a noble person. That is why my grandfather went from a prison cell to helping overturn apartheid, winning over the most ardent critics in South Africa.

He was talking about his sworn enemy Richard Nixon, but it applies just the same to the appalling damage we’re doing to our planet. Newspaper articles, charity reports and activist speeches abound – all earnest and arguably objective, but they somehow fail to capture the true meaning of what’s being lost in the natural world.  Perhaps that’s why novelists writing about ecological issues is such a compelling subgenre – they can’t help but let the subjective seep into their nonfiction.  Arundhati Roy on the ghastly impact of mega-dam projects  in India, Jonathan Safran Foer’s heartbreaking description of pregnant pigs in concrete pens in   Eating Animals  , or Bruce Chatwin’s lyrical passages about the Australian outback in  The Songlines : each does more to broaden our eco-consciousness than a thousand turgid – but well-meaning – thinktank research papers.  The latest novelist to write about nature is Annie Proulx, who in  Fen, Bog   &amp; Swamp  draws our attention to the largely unloved wetlands that are being destroyed around the world. The Harvard biologist EO Wilson wrote that chopping down the rainforest to make money is like burning a priceless Renaissance painting to cook a meal. Proulx wants us to see the loss of wetlands in the same way – and to appreciate the beauty in these swampy and often stinking places. Boy, does she succeed. The prose is just magnificent, bringing to life hitherto overlooked habitats such as “the primordial intensity of the bog’s unmoving tannin-dark water and massed sphagnum”, where “black arms of drowned forests protrude from the water”.

The Guardian has often taken a less Shakespearean approach. Its reports of George VI’s lying in state, witnessed by  nearly 300,000 people  over three days, are lively with detail. Some aspects of queue behaviour still apply: there are ways of jumping it. In 1952, the jumpers honourably included “nurses who had been on night duty” and, perhaps less forgivably, “the boys and masters of Westminster School”, who had been led in through a side door. Other things belong to history. Telephone boxes overflowed with pennies from husbands taking “a minute to explain that they would be home late”. A party from a girls’ college in Berkshire had arrived through the snow by taking an early morning “workmen’s train”, evidence of their enterprise in an age when “workmen” travelled early and the middle class came late.

The great photographer talks about his tough childhood, the film Angelina Jolie is making about him – and the shots that still haunt his sleep  Don McCullin was with a US soldier on the fortified walls surrounding the Vietnamese city of Hué one night when he noticed something in the dark. “A hand grenade had been tossed over. We both looked at it. Then the soldier went one way and I went the other. It exploded. I thought I’d lost my leg but I was lucky. The explosion hit the other guy, killed him. I photographed him dying with blood coming out of his nose and a river of blood coming out of his head because it blew the back of his skull out.”  He shows me a new print he’s made of that image, blood still glistening 54 years on.

It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv region. “From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,” it said on Telegram.   Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region over the past day  while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday.   The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia.  “Perhaps it seems to some of you that after a series of victories we now have a lull of sorts,” he said in his nightly address on Sunday. “But there will be no lull. There is preparation for the next series ... For Ukraine must be free. All of it.”   In an intelligence update, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified.  “As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government,” it said on Sunday.   Ukrainian   forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts  to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops.   The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones,  the New York Times  reported  on Sunday.   According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that  Ukraine  launched in the north-eastern regions of the country this month.   The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds , according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.   The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force had successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points.   The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in  Ukraine  and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”.  The remarks are the first time that the pop star, an icon in  Russia , has  publicly criticised the conflict.  Addressing the Russian justice ministry, Pugacheva told her 3.4 million Instagram followers: “I am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country.”   The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against  Russia  on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium  last week. Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium”, adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice”, the Kyiv Independent reported.   The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes  in Ukraine. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London.

Instead she is stuck in the past  A new school year is under way, and already pressures are acute. The  six-month freeze  on energy bills promised by the prime minister offers short-term relief but leaves headteachers to puzzle over what happens next. Schools in England are expected to turn to reserves – if they have them. With a 5% pay rise for teachers also due to come out of existing budgets, finances are precarious.  Teaching assistants’ jobs are at risk, along with  educational trips . Senior Conservative figures are among those  warning  that high inflation and funding shortfalls are placing headteachers in an impossible position. The post-pandemic catchup is far from complete, after the  botched outsourcing  of the main tutoring contract. Added to these problems is a shortage of teachers that ministers have known about for years. A recruitment and retention strategy announced in 2019 has not brought results. Instead, new figures show that the situation is getting worse, with vacancies at their  highest level since 2010 . This year just 25% of the required number of trainee physics teachers have been recruited. Almost half of teachers say they  plan to quit  within five years.

The proposed  privatisation of Channel 4  is one of them: here is the perfect opportunity to quietly drop plans that, even according to the government’s  own consultation paper , hardly anyone wants. Nadine Dorries led the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport   (DCMS) up to the top of the ideological hill, like the grand old Duke of York, without checking that her muskets were primed. So the government’s tactics, such as meddling with the wording of the channel’s annual report to bring it to heel, looked petty and ridiculous because its field commander  appeared not to understand  what exactly it would be privatising.  The set-up of Channel 4 is admittedly complicated. Established by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1982 to produce “innovative, alternative content that challenges the status quo”, it is publicly owned but commercially funded. Unlike the BBC – which is financed through the licence fee – it makes no call on taxpayers, who would therefore have no financial gain from its privatisation. The advertising market on which it relies is tough, but there are better ways to support it than to flog it off, such as taxing online advertising on commercial streaming platforms,  as suggested by  the Media Reform Coalition.

For our new PM, the problem’s ideological  As this most strange and surreal of national moments has unfolded, voices of power and influence have constantly talked about national unity and shared feeling. The media are suddenly  awash  with “we” and “us”. All those flowers, flags and banners embody the same message: that whatever this country’s tensions and resentments, the United Kingdom remains exactly that. But, by a grim accident of timing, when politics resumes this week the biggest story will be about something that suggests the exact opposite: a government so unconcerned by the huge gaps that divide people and places that it is going to widen them even further.  Friday will see the much-trailed “fiscal event” in which the new chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, will outline the  details  of the government’s energy price freeze and the tax cuts promised by Liz Truss in her campaign for the Tory leadership. The Resolution Foundation  reckons  that, on average, the richest tenth of households will benefit from these measures by about £4,700 a year, while the poorest tenth will receive £2,200. By way of adding insult to injury, towards the end of last week news broke of Kwarteng’s push to  remove  the existing cap on banker’s bonuses, a legacy of our membership of the EU. As with Truss’s  hostility  to an extended windfall tax on the big energy companies, here was more proof of her government’s key intention: to “go for growth” by privileging wealthy and powerful people and interests, in the hope that doing so might boost the UK’s output.

It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv region. “From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,” it said on Telegram.   Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region over the past day  while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday.   The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia.  “Perhaps it seems to some of you that after a series of victories we now have a lull of sorts,” he said in his nightly address on Sunday. “But there will be no lull. There is preparation for the next series ... For Ukraine must be free. All of it.”   In an intelligence update, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified.  “As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government,” it said on Sunday.   Ukrainian   forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts  to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops.   The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones,  the New York Times  reported  on Sunday.   According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that  Ukraine  launched in the north-eastern regions of the country this month.   The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds , according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.   The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force had successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points.   The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in  Ukraine  and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”.  The remarks are the first time that the pop star, an icon in  Russia , has  publicly criticised the conflict.  Addressing the Russian justice ministry, Pugacheva told her 3.4 million Instagram followers: “I am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country.”   The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against  Russia  on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium  last week. Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium”, adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice”, the Kyiv Independent reported.   The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes  in Ukraine. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London.

Instead she is stuck in the past  A new school year is under way, and already pressures are acute. The  six-month freeze  on energy bills promised by the prime minister offers short-term relief but leaves headteachers to puzzle over what happens next. Schools in England are expected to turn to reserves – if they have them. With a 5% pay rise for teachers also due to come out of existing budgets, finances are precarious.  Teaching assistants’ jobs are at risk, along with  educational trips . Senior Conservative figures are among those  warning  that high inflation and funding shortfalls are placing headteachers in an impossible position. The post-pandemic catchup is far from complete, after the  botched outsourcing  of the main tutoring contract. Added to these problems is a shortage of teachers that ministers have known about for years. A recruitment and retention strategy announced in 2019 has not brought results. Instead, new figures show that the situation is getting worse, with vacancies at their  highest level since 2010 . This year just 25% of the required number of trainee physics teachers have been recruited. Almost half of teachers say they  plan to quit  within five years.

The proposed  privatisation of Channel 4  is one of them: here is the perfect opportunity to quietly drop plans that, even according to the government’s  own consultation paper , hardly anyone wants. Nadine Dorries led the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport   (DCMS) up to the top of the ideological hill, like the grand old Duke of York, without checking that her muskets were primed. So the government’s tactics, such as meddling with the wording of the channel’s annual report to bring it to heel, looked petty and ridiculous because its field commander  appeared not to understand  what exactly it would be privatising.  The set-up of Channel 4 is admittedly complicated. Established by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1982 to produce “innovative, alternative content that challenges the status quo”, it is publicly owned but commercially funded. Unlike the BBC – which is financed through the licence fee – it makes no call on taxpayers, who would therefore have no financial gain from its privatisation. The advertising market on which it relies is tough, but there are better ways to support it than to flog it off, such as taxing online advertising on commercial streaming platforms,  as suggested by  the Media Reform Coalition.

For our new PM, the problem’s ideological  As this most strange and surreal of national moments has unfolded, voices of power and influence have constantly talked about national unity and shared feeling. The media are suddenly  awash  with “we” and “us”. All those flowers, flags and banners embody the same message: that whatever this country’s tensions and resentments, the United Kingdom remains exactly that. But, by a grim accident of timing, when politics resumes this week the biggest story will be about something that suggests the exact opposite: a government so unconcerned by the huge gaps that divide people and places that it is going to widen them even further.  Friday will see the much-trailed “fiscal event” in which the new chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, will outline the  details  of the government’s energy price freeze and the tax cuts promised by Liz Truss in her campaign for the Tory leadership. The Resolution Foundation  reckons  that, on average, the richest tenth of households will benefit from these measures by about £4,700 a year, while the poorest tenth will receive £2,200.

Now it’s heading for a new low | Jamie Mackay","If Giorgia Meloni comes to power at the head of a far-right coalition, the economic and social outcomes could be terrible  Earlier this month, Alessio Di Giulio, a Florentine councillor with rightwing populist party the League,  posted  a 17-second video that, to my mind, marks the nadir of what has been one of the most grotesque Italian election campaigns in recent memory. In the clip, Di Giulio strolls through the historic centre of the Tuscan capital when he comes across a woman who appears to be   of Roma origin. Stopping in his tracks, the candidate leans into the camera and implores his audience to “vote the League to never see her again”, a phrase he repeats three times for rhetorical effect.  Most Italians were appalled, and the video went viral. Which was, of course, Di Giulio’s hope all along. You can see it from the smile on his face. He was surely aware, when he uploaded his clip, that there was no chance of voters in his left-leaning constituency shifting their support. His gesture was purely performative, a tacit reminder to political sympathisers across the nation that if Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy wins this week’s election,  as expected , people like him will soon have an opportunity to shape the policy agenda.

Now he will be leading his team once again  There’s  an old saying  in NFL circles: “If you have two quarterbacks, you actually have none.” Well, tell that to the San Francisco 49ers, who have learned the value of keeping two qualified starters. While the 49ers were criticized for handing backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo a guaranteed one-year deal in the offseason rather than trading him for whatever they could get, the move may have saved their season after Trey Lance  went down with a broken ankle  on Sunday.  The extent of Lance’s injury was not known when the team put Garoppolo – previously labeled “the world’s most expensive backup”  by some of the snarkier members of the media  – on the field against the Seattle Seahawks in the first quarter. As per usual, it was an efficient but not flashy performance from Garoppolo, who had both a passing and rushing touchdown while throwing for 154 yards without a single pick. The 49ers defeated the Seahawks 27-7, notching their first win of the season while handing Seattle their first loss.
